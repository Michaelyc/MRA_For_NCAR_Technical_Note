# Name with the path for the data file. It should be a binary file. The first number is the number of observations n that is stored as an unsigned 64-bit integer. Following are n longitudes, n latitudes, and n observation values, each element of which is stored as a 64-bit real number.

# The flag for whether to eliminate duplicates in the raw data. If it is guaranteed that there are no duplicates in the raw data, set the flag to "false" to save computation time. Must be either "true" or "false".

# The ratio of the smallest distance between any knot and the region boundary to the length of the region in each dimension. Requires a numerical value or "default" to use the default value exp/100.
	OFFSET=default

# The number of subregions in each partitioning. Requires to be either 2 or 4.
	NUM_PARTITIONS_J=2

# The number of knots in each region before the finest resolution level. The number of knots at the finest resolution level is automatically determined by the data and the built structure, and the number can be different in different regions at the finest resolution level.
	NUM_KNOTS_r=49

# The number of levels. Requires a positive integer or "default" to use the number that is automatically determined from NUM_PARTITIONS_J and NUM_KNOTS_r by making the average number of observations per region at the finest resolution level similar to the number of knots in regions before the finest resolution level.

# The flag for whether to print more details of the loaded data and the built structure. Must be either "true" or "false".
	PRINT_DETAIL_FLAG=true

# The type of calculations. Must be one of "prediction", "optimization", "likelihood", "build_structure_only". If the value is "build_structure_only", only the hierarchical structure is built, and an output file "structure_information.txt" will be generated to show the details of the built structure.

# The way of specifying the prediction locations. Must be one of 'D' for all the locations in DATA_FILE_NAME no matter whether the associated observation is a valid value or NaN, 'N' for locations in DATA_FILE_NAME that only have NaN values, 'A' for locations specified in PREDICTION_LOCATION_FILE.
    PREDICTION_LOCATION_MODE=D

# Name for the prediction location file. Only used when PREDICTION_LOCATION_MODE='A'. It should be a binary file. The first number is the number of observations np that is stored as an unsigned 64-bit integer. Following are np longitudes and np latitudes, each element of which is stored as a 64-bit real number.

# The flag for whether to dump prediction results to an output file specified by PREDICTION_RESULTS_FILE_NAME.  Must be either "true" or "false".
	DUMP_PREDICTION_RESULTS_FLAG=true

# The output file for storing prediction results. Only used when DUMP_PREDICTION_RESULTS_FLAG="true" and CALCULATION_MODE="predict". Multiple files will be generated to save the prediction results if more than one MPI process is used. Each file will save the prediction results in the following way: the first number is the number of predictions by this MPI process nr stored as an unsigned 64-bit integer, and following are nr longitudes, nr latitudes, nr prediction means, and nr prediction variances, as 64-bit real numbers.

# The flag for whether to save temporary files to disk. Must be either "true" or "false".

# The directory for saving the temporary files on disk. Make sure the specified directory exists. Only used when "SAVE_TO_DISK"="true".
